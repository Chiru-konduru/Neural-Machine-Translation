# Neural-Machine-Translation
Spanish to English Neural Machine Translation using RNNs and Transformers. This is one of the assignments of CS447: Natural Language Processing at UIUC.

Specifically, we are going to train **sequence to sequence** models for Spanish to English translation. In this assignment I implemented the neural network models, all the  data loading was implemented in prior. I referred the following resources for more details during this implementation:
